CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

ANY OTHER NOTES FOR THE GRADER:

CoinTossSImulatorTest.java contains two more blocks of code to test 
question 2 and 3 below. These two parts of code are commented out 
initially.

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):


----------------------------------------------
1. What is the probability of each of the three outcomes in a trial: 
two heads, one head and one tail, and two tails? Why is one of them 
different than the other two?

One head and one tail is roughly as twice as much as the other two 
outcomes in large trials, since there are 1/2 probability could 
yield one head and one tail verses 1/4 probability yielding each 
of the other two outcomes.


2. Roughly how many trials do you need to do before you mostly get 
results within 1% of these probabilities? Do several simulations 
using your program to determine an answer to this.

34 trails min.





3. Roughly how many trials can you do before it crashes with an 
overflow error? State the largest value you tried where it still 
worked correctly, and one where it overflowed. You can get an idea 
of what general values to try by looking at the limits on Java 
integers (see Section 4.1.1 of the text). Play around with your 
program to verify that it actually works for very large values that 
are within the limits. Warning: For very large values you may have
to wait a fair amount of time before you get the results (probably 
slower on aludra than on you own machine).
